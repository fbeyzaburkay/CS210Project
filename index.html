    <h1>Spotify Playlist Generator by User Mood</h1>

    <p>This Python project analyzes my music data from Spotify using unsupervised machine learning and creates a personalized playlist based on user mood input and genre preferences input.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>The motivation behind this project stems from my desire to explore the intersection of data science and music,
        leveraging Spotify's API to analyze and understand musical preferences based on the user's mood and preferred
        genre.</p>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The dataset utilized in this project was personally extracted using Spotipy, a Python library enabling access to
        the Spotify Web API.</p>

    <h2>Data Analysis Steps:</h2>

    <h3>1. Data Extraction and Preprocessing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extracted detailed information about tracks from multiple of my Spotify playlists using Spotipy with my
            Spotify API credentials.</li>
        <li>Extracted track details from Spotify playlists, stores the data in a 'proj.csv' CSV file, and assigns each
            track a 'Main Genre' based on predefined conditions related to the 'Genres' column.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. EDA and Hypothesis Testing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilized pandas and seaborn for exploring and visualizing the dataset. Created heatmaps for showing the
            correlations of features. Subplots for easily exploring the dataset.</li>
        <li>Implemented hypothesis testing and regression analysis to understand the relationship between music features
            and showed significance in relationship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Cluster Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Applied K-Means clustering to group songs based on features like Valence, Energy, and Loudness.</li>
        <li>Evaluated cluster quality using silhouette analysis and elbow plots and decided on using k=5 clusters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Silhouette Plots</h4>

        alt="Elbow Plots of SSE and Explained Variance">

    <h3>4. Feature Engineering and Visualization:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a new User Mood column by taking weighted averages of Valence, Energy, and Loudness.</li>
        <li>Visualized the distribution of music features and genres within each cluster. Each cluster shows different
            values for music features, showing the distinction amongst clusters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Subplots for Cluster Analysis</h4>

        alt="Subplots for Cluster Analysis">

    <h3>5. Playlist Generation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Took user mood input within a 0.5 range and retrieves corresponding music clusters.</li>
        <li>Allowed users to select preferred genres.</li>
        <li>Generated a playlist from the selected clusters and genres.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sample of Generated Playlist by User Mood and Genre Preference</h4>

    <h2>Findings</h2>

    <h3>1. Pop and Rock Trends:</h3>
    <p>High User Mood for Pop and Rock: Most of my Pop and Rock songs exhibit high User Mood indexes, suggesting a
        preference for uplifting or energetic tracks.</p>

    <h3>2. Electronic, Progressive Rock, and House Trends:</h3>
    <p>Low User Mood Index: Surprisingly, Electronic, Progressive Rock, and House songs tend to have lower User Mood
        indexes. This finding suggests a potential inclination towards genres that may have a more subdued or varied
        emotional tone, also may be caused by the subtext of the song lyrics.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <p>In the future, I aim to enhance the project by integrating the `get.recommendations()` function from Spotipy
        authorization, enabling the generation of personalized song recommendations based on the User Mood formula derived
        from Valence, Energy, and Loudness features. This planned enhancement will offer an enriched music exploration
        experience, allowing for the discovery of new and fitting songs within the defined mood and genre
        preferences.</p>
