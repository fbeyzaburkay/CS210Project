# Spotify Playlist Generator by User Mood

This Python project analyzes my music data from Spotify using unsupervised machine learning and creates a personalized playlist based on user mood input and genre preferences input.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from my desire to explore the intersection of data science and music, leveraging Spotify's API to analyze and understand musical preferences based on user's mood and preferred genre.

## Data Source
The dataset utilized in this project was personally extracted using Spotipy, a Python library enabling access to the Spotify Web API.‚Äã

## Data Analysis Steps:
The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Extraction and Preprocessing:**

  - Extracted detailed information about tracks from multiple of my Spotify playlists using Spotipy with my Spotify API credentials.
  - Extracted track details from Spotify playlists, stores the data in a 'proj.csv' CSV file, and assigns each track a 'Main Genre' based on predefined conditions related to the 'Genres' column.

2. **EDA and Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Utilized pandas and seaborn for exploring and visualizing the dataset. Created heatmaps for showing the correlations of features. Subplots for easily exploring the dataset.
  - Implemented hypothesis testing and regression analysis to understand the relationship between music features and showed significance in relationship.

3. **Cluster Analysis:**
  - Applied K-Means clustering to group songs based on features like Valence, Energy, and Loudness.
   - Evaluated cluster quality using silhouette analysis and elbow plots and decided on using k=5 clusters.

4. **Feature Engineering and Playlist Generation:**
  - Created a new User Mood column by taking weighted averages of Valence, Energy and Loudness.
  - Took user mood input within a 0.5 range and retrieves corresponding music clusters.
   - Allowed users to select preferred genres.
   - Generated a playlist from the selected clusters and genres.

5. **Visualization:**
  - Visualized the distribution of music features and genres within each cluster. Each cluster shows different values for music features, showing the distinction amongst clusters.

## Findings


## Sample of Generated Playlist

# Get user input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Print a personalized greeting
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to the project.")
